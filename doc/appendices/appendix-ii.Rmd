# Appendix ii

Here we show the beta coefficients from the regression analysis used to infer the extent to which data skewness and kurtosis might predict error in effect size estimates. The equations may be beneficial to those with similar data who wish to determine the extent to which their effect size estimate may be imprecise. 

```{r, regs, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo=FALSE}

regs_out<- data.frame(effect = c("AB", "MT", "MT x mod", "SRT", "CC tt", "CC b x tt"),
                         Intercept = c("-$0.83^{***}$", "0.04   ", "-1.47", "-$2.82^{***}$", "$0.14^{***}$", "-$2.59^{***}$"),
                         Skewness = c("-$0.06^{***+}$", "-$0.02^{***+}$", "$0.20^{***+}$", "-$0.28^{***+}$", "0.00", "-0.03"),
                         Kurtosis = c("$0.01^{***+}$", "$0.02^{***+}$", "$0.87^{***+}$", "$0.13^{**+}$", "-0.01", "-0.02"),
                      IntraVariance = c("$0.04^{***}$", "-0.02", "-$24.03^{***}$", "-$0.71^{***}$", "-$1.64^{***}$", "$0.33^{***}$"),
                      IntraSkewness = c("-$1.54^{***+}$", "$0.10^{***+}$", "1.88", "$0.24^{***+}$", "$0.11^{***}$", "0.35"),
                      IntraKurtosis = c("-$1.87^{***}$", "-$0.04^{**}$", "-0.51", "-$0.33^{**}$", "0.02", "0.02"))
