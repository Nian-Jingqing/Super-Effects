Notes on supplemental figures

Filenames:
Fig2_AB.png
Fig4_MT.png
Fig7_CC.png
Fig9_SRT.png

Notes: These figures show the results when a biased effect size measure (partial eta square, or d using pooled standard deviation) is used, instead of the effect size measures reported in the manuscript. Full figure legends can be found in the files.

Notes: probit transformed p-values for the AB and MT paradigms. A) AB: p-values for selected N for the main effect of lag. B) Showing the mean p-values, and the UB and LB quantiles [.025, .975], for the main effect of lag, across N (AB). C) MT: Same as in A, but for the main effect of task condition (MT). D) Same as in B, for the main effect of task condition (MT), E) As in C, but for the task x modality interaction (MT), E) As D, but for the MT task x modality interaction

EPS_IL_tasks_ps.pdf

Notes: probit transformed p-values oserved for the SRT and CC paradigms. A) SRT: p-values for effect of sequence learning, for selected N. B) Showing the mean p-value, and the UB and LB quantiles [.025, .975], for the effect of sequence, across N (SRT). C) CC: Same as in A, but for the block x condition interaction. D) Same as in B, for the block x condition interaction (CC), E) As in C, but for the main effect of condition (CC), E) As D, but for the main effect of condition (CC)
