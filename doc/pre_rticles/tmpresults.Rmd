## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


### Attentional Blink

```{r, ABsimresults, fig.width=7, fig.asp=1, fig.cap="AB simulation results. A) showing Cohen's {d} attained for each sample size for the FFX modelling for the main effect of lag, B) showing Cohen's $d$ attained from the RFX modelling of lag + subject intercept, C) showing the log p-values attained across simulations at each sample size N for the FFX model, the vertical dashed line shows log(p=.05). Note: all p-values to the left of this line would result in a rejection of the null hypothesis.  D) same as C, except for the RFX model."}
task = "AB"
med = 24
d_scale_ffx = 2
d_scale_rfx = d_scale_ffx
p_scale_ffx = d_scale_ffx
p_scale_rfx = d_scale_ffx
px_rng_d = c(0,5)
px_rng_p_ffx = c(-800,0)
px_rng_p_rfx = c(-800,0)
plot.in.doc(task, med, d_scale_ffx, d_scale_rfx, p_scale_ffx, p_scale_rfx, px_rng_d, px_rng_p_ffx, px_rng_p_rfx)


```

Notes: large Cohen's $d$, it looks like RFX modelling suggests a larger range of effect sizes for smaller sample sizes, but that this issue goes away as the precision capacity of the estimate increases. For FFX, sample sizes > 18 ensure the alternate will not be rejected, whereas for RFX, all exp sizes = reject null.  

Idea: ratio of range of d-values for each model/N?

### Dual-task

### Contextual Cueing

```

Putative reason for differences in effect size observations between FFX and RFX: FFX models deviations from the grand mean - therefore a subject that shows a large deviation from the grand mean can inflate the variance soaked up by the condition regressor. As the RFX model includes a subject intercept, the regressor of interest can only soak up the variance of interest.

Q: are large effect size observations driven by individuals who are far from the grand mean?

- note from Chris: plot effect size vs p
- also, can you get sig with consistent d=.05 across subs?

One clue towards these thoughts would be if the subject intercept estimates showed, on some simulations, larger values than on other simulations - i.e. the distribution should be skewed or bimodal.

### Serial Response Task

```{r, SRTsimresults, warning=F, echo=F, fig.width=7, fig.asp=1, fig.cap="Serial Response Task simulation results. A) showing Cohen's {d} attained for each sample size for the FFX modelling, using a within-subjects t-test to compare condition (repeat vs novel), B) showing Cohen's $d$ attained from the RFX modelling with an additional subject intercept, C) showing the log p-values attained across simulations at each sample size N for the FFX model, the vertical dashed line shows log(p=.05). D) same as C, except for the RFX model."}

task = "SRT"
med = 39
d_scale_ffx = 2
d_scale_rfx = d_scale_ffx
p_scale_ffx = d_scale_ffx
p_scale_rfx = d_scale_ffx
px_rng_d = c(0,3)
px_rng_p_ffx = c(-400,0)
px_rng_p_rfx = c(-400,0)
plot.in.doc(task, med, d_scale_ffx, d_scale_rfx, p_scale_ffx, p_scale_rfx, px_rng_d, px_rng_p_ffx, px_rng_p_rfx)
# med = 39, d_scale_ffx = 2, d_scale_rfx = 2, p_scale_ffx = 2, p_scale_rfx = 2, p_rng_d = c(0,3), px_rng_p_ffx = c(-400,0), px_rng_p_rfx = c(-400,0)


```

Note: FFX leads you awry far more often than RFX
Modelling subject means is important for implicit learning tasks.

# clean up AB data
